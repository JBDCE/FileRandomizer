# FileRandomizer

## A Short Programm to Randomize the files in a given Folder

This program was developed in one night. To shuffle the filenames inside of a folder around. It does not alter any of the other files information or contents. 

### Goals

[ ] Run the software by placing it inside the folder with the files to be renamed and excecute it with no runtime arguments

[ ] Check if all of the files have the same file format, abbort execution if the files formats do not match

[ ] After Shuffling create a output.log file that lists the mapping of the randomised files or displays an error log

[ ] Keep the files contens md5 accurate (Maybe test that after shuffling automatically)
